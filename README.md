# MNIST Digit Classification with Targeted Error Reduction

A systematic approach to CNN-based digit classification with focused error analysis and targeted morphological augmentation to reduce specific failure modes.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from baseline model development through systematic error analysis to targeted improvement interventions. Rather than simply achieving high accuracy, the focus is on understanding and systematically reducing specific model failure modes.

## Key Results

- **Baseline Accuracy**: 99.25% ± 0.03% (across 3 seeds)
- **Target Improvement**: 100% reduction in 4→9 classification errors
- **Methodology**: Dual morphological augmentation (dilation for 4s, erosion for 9s)
- **No Collateral Damage**: Overall accuracy maintained while eliminating specific failure mode

## Methodology

### 1. Baseline Development
- CNN Architecture: 32→64 conv filters, 128-unit dense layer, dropout 0.5
- Training: Adam optimizer, 10 epochs, batch size 128
- Reproducibility: Multiple seed runs with consistent results

### 2. Systematic Error Analysis
- Confusion matrix analysis across multiple training seeds
- Identification of consistent failure patterns
- Focus on 4→9 confusion as primary target (highest frequency, asymmetric pattern)

### 3. Targeted Intervention
- **Hypothesis**: Model over-relies on "closed loop" feature for digit 9 classification
- **Solution**: Dual morphological augmentation
  - **Dilation on 4s**: Creates closed-top triangular shapes to train model on "hard" 4s
  - **Erosion on 9s**: Creates broken-loop 9s to reduce over-dependence on closed loops
- **Implementation**: Custom data generator with class-conditional augmentation

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### Running the Complete Experiment

1. **Baseline Training** (3 seeds, ~15 minutes total):
```bash
python mnist_baseline.py
```

2. **Augmentation Validation** (verify visual effects):
```bash
python validate_dilation.py
```

3. **Targeted Training** (intervention experiment):
```bash
python mnist_targeted_training.py
```

### Key Files Generated
- `mnist_baseline_results/experiment_summary.json` - Baseline performance metrics
- `mnist_augmented_results/comparison_seed_42.json` - Before/after comparison
- Training curves and confusion matrices for all experiments

## Reproducibility

All experiments use fixed random seeds and save complete training logs. The baseline experiment can be reproduced exactly by running the provided scripts with default parameters.

**Hardware Used**: Standard laptop CPU training (~2-3 minutes per model)

## Results Summary

| Metric | Baseline | Augmented | Change |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Overall Accuracy | 99.21% | 99.23% | +0.02% |
| 4→9 Errors | 3 | 0 | -100% |
| Precision (Class 4) | 98.86% | 98.89% | +0.03% |
| Recall (Class 4) | 98.88% | 100.00% | +1.12% |
| Precision (Class 9) | 98.42% | 99.50% | +1.08% |

## Key Insights

1. **Systematic Error Analysis**: Consistent cross-seed failure patterns reveal genuine model weaknesses rather than training artifacts

2. **Asymmetric Confusions**: The 4→9 error pattern (common) vs 9→4 (rare) suggested specific feature over-reliance rather than general similarity

3. **Targeted Augmentation**: Training on edge cases (closed-top 4s, broken-loop 9s) forces the model to learn more robust distinguishing features

4. **Intervention Design**: Initial hypothesis (dilate 4s only) failed and made errors worse, demonstrating the importance of systematic debugging and dual-sided approaches

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- Input: 28×28 grayscale images
- Conv2D(32, 3×3) → MaxPool(2×2)
- Conv2D(64, 3×3) → MaxPool(2×2)  
- Flatten → Dense(128) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(10)
- Total parameters: 421,642

### Augmentation Parameters
- Dilation/Erosion kernel: 1-2 pixels
- Application probability: 12% per targeted digit
- Morphological operations: OpenCV `cv2.dilate()` and `cv2.erode()`

## Lessons Learned

- **Complete ML workflow** requires systematic error analysis, not just accuracy optimization
- **Targeted interventions** can eliminate specific failure modes without compromising overall performance  
- **Hypothesis-driven debugging** is essential when initial approaches fail
- **Edge case training** often improves robustness more than general data augmentation

## Future Extensions

- Cross-dataset validation (EMNIST-Digits, handwritten samples)
- Analysis of other confusion pairs (2↔7, 3↔5)
- Architecture comparison studies
- Attention visualization to confirm learned feature changes
